# Weather App Project Instructions

This is a React weather app project built with Vite. The app will:
- Display current weather information
- Show weather forecasts
- Allow users to search for different cities
- Use a weather API to fetch real-time data
- Focus on clean, modern UI/UX design

When working on this project:
- Keep components small and focused
- Use modern React patterns (hooks, functional components)
- Prioritize responsive design
- Write clean, readable code with good variable names
- Add comments to explain complex logic
